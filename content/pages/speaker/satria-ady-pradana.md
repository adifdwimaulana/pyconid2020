speaker_abstract: Red-Teaming is a simulation of real world hacking against organization. It has little to no limit of time, location, and method to attack. Only results matter. Red-Team operation often used to simulate how much damage company can suffer, from which side it come, and how deep they are. Unlike "normal" attack simulation, Red-Teaming not only focusing on application but any possible components.
    This talk gives insight about how "hacker" works and how python can be used for sophisticated series of attack.
