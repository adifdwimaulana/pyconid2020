speaker_bio: I always liked looking into programming languages. In particular, I have long advocated for the use of functional programming over object-oriented programming and a declarative style over an imperative one. Despite having used Python heavily since 2013, groking Scala, Haskell and Clojure really changed my style of writing Python code. I would like to share some of my findings and advocate a functional style of programming in Python. My other interests include Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods and high-performance computing. I am a co-founder of Zero One Group, an Indonesia-based technology company that aims to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia. Zero One products are mainly divided into Zero One Technology (automation and optimisation specialists), Zero One Consulting (CTO as a service) and Zero One Digital (comprehensive digital marketing services). I have spoken in a number of recent PyCons: <br> 1. Functional Programming in Python: Lessons from Haskell and Clojure in PyCon Thailand 2019. <br> 2. Property-Based Testing in Python with Hypothesis in PyCon APAC 2019 and PyCon Malaysia 2018. <br> 3. The Quest for Fast Python in PyCon Indonesia 2018. <br> 4. Pythonic Functional Programming with Coconut in PyCon Thailand 2018.
speaker_abstract: Nowadays, FP is becoming more and more popular. New languages founded upon FP principles continue to appear, and more mature languages are racing to onboard FP features - even Java. In this talk, we introduce FP as 1) programming without side effects and 2) the declarative-style of programming. 
    We illustrate the importance of these two concepts using examples in Python. We compare FP-style Python with textbook OO-style Python. Finally, we discuss how to practice FP best in Python, which is not traditionally a functional language, whilst remaining idiomatic.
