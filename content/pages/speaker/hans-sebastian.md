speaker_abstract: The first part of this talk, I will talk about various tools (10 mins): 
    * pytest 
    * flake8 
    * black 
    * docker 
    * and a few more 
    <br>Then, I'll describe a simple application, either for providing an API or a rather complex business logic. The idea is to write the code until it becomes functional. But, I'll discuss the logic and scenarios together the audience (10 mins). 
    <br>Once we're confident on how to implement it, then I'll write the code utilizing the tools that I have mentioned earlier and illustrate their benefits (20 mins).
